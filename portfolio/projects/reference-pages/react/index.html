            <h2>The Virtual DOM</h2>
            <p>The react <strong>Virtual DOM</strong> serves to solve inneficiency issues when it comes to
                manipulating
                the DOM.
                Normally, when a DOM node/element is updated, the browser re-renders the entire DOM. This is because
                it
                is very costly to figure out exactly where a change occurred, so it is must easier to just re-render
                everything. This is very
                costly, especially if there are lots of DOM manipulations going on. The <strong>Virtual
                    DOM</strong>,
                which is a JavaScript object stored in main memory (virtual), is a representation of the regular
                DOM.
                For every DOM object, there is a corresponsing "virtual DOM object."</p>
            <p>A virtual DOM object has the same properties as a real DOM object, but it lacks the real thing's
                power to
                directly change what's on the screen. Manipulating the DOM is slow. Manipulating the virtual DOM is
                much
                faster because nothing gets drawn
                onscreen. Think of manipulating the virtual DOM as editing a blueprint, as opposed to moving rooms
                in an
                actual house.</p>
            <h3>How the Virtual DOM worls</h3>
            <p>When an virtual DOM object is changed, the entire Virtual DOM is updated. This is not inefficient
                because
                the virtual DOM can update very quickly. Once the virtual DOM has been updated, React compares the
                current virtual DOM to a snapshot of a previous version (<strong>diffing</strong>). This allows
                React to
                figure out exactly which
                virtual DOM object changed, and thus to update only that object in the real dom.</p>
            <h2>Why React</h2>
            <p>React.js is a JavaScript library developed by engineers at Facebook. It is fast, modular, scalable,
                and
                flexible.</p>
