            <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
            <p><strong>HTTP</strong> stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is used to structure requests and
                responses
                over the internet. <strong>HTTP</strong> requires that data is transferred from one point to another
                over
                the network.</p>

            <h2>What is TCP?</h2>
            <p><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) is what actually handles the transfer of data. TCP
                is
                used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer wants to send data to another.

            <h2>How do HTTP and TCP work together?</h2>
            <p>When you type an address into the browser to load a webpage, you command <strong>TCP</strong> to open a
                connection between your
                browser (the client) and the server to which the url relates to. Once the TCP connection is established,
                the
                client sends a <strong>HTTP <i>GET</i></strong> request to
                request the webpage. With HTTP/1.0 (the first version of HTTP), once the browser sends back a response,
                the <strong>TCP</strong> connection is closed.</p>

                <h2>What are APIs?</h2>
                <p>An <strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> is a software tool that makes it easier
                    for
                    developers to interact with another application to use some of that application's functionality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Browser APIs</strong> are specific to writing code that interacts with the browser. See
                        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API" target="_blank">MDN's documentation

                    <h4>3rd Part APIs</h4>
                    <p>These are APIs provided by third parties, usually companies. Organizations that maintain
                        third-party APIs often set their own rules and requirements for how users utilize their API.</p>

            <h2>What is REST?</h2>
            <p>REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between
                computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other. REST-compliant
                systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are stateless and separate the
                concerns of client and server.</p>
            <h3>Separation of Client and Server</h3>
            <p>In the REST architectural style, the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server
                can be done independently without each knowing about the other. This means that the code on the client
                side can be changed at any time without affecting the operation of the server, and the code on the
                server side can be changed without affecting the operation of the client. As long as each side knows
                what format of messages to send to the other, they can be kept modular and separate. Separating the user
                interface concerns from the data storage concerns, we improve the flexibility of the interface across
                platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components. Additionally, the separation
                allows each component the ability to evolve independently.</p>
            <h3>Statelessness</h3>
            <p>Systems that follow the REST paradigm are stateless, meaning that the server does not need to know
                anything about what state the client is in and vice versa. In this way, both the server and the client
                can understand any message received, even without seeing previous messages. This constraint of
                statelessness is enforced through the use of <strong>resources</strong>, rather than
                <strong>commands</strong>. Resources are the nouns of
                the Web - they describe any object, document, or thing that you may need to store or send to other
                services.
            </p>
            <h3>Communication between Client and Server</h3>
            <p>In <strong>REST</strong> architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, and
                serverse respond to those requests.</p>
            <h3>Making Requests</h3>
            <p>REST requires that the client makes requests to retrieve or modify a resource. This request will include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An HTTP verb, which defines the operation to perform.</li>
                <li>A <i>header</i>, which allows the client to pass along information about the request</li>
                <li>A path to the resource</li>
                <li>An optional <i>body</i> containing data</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>HTTP Verbs</h4>
            <p>There are 4 basic HTTP verbs in a REST system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>GET - retrieve a specific resource by id (or a collection of resources)</li>
                <li>POST - create a new resource</li>
                <li>PUT - update a resource</li>
                <li>DELETE - delete a resource</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Headers and Accept parameters</h4>
            <p>In the header of the request, the client specifies the type of content that it can receive. This is
                called the <strong>Accept</strong> field. The values provided in the accept field are <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types"
                    target="_blank">MIME types</a> (or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions). MIME types consist of a
                <strong>type</strong> and a <strong>subtype</strong>. <strong>text/html</strong> and
                <strong>image/png</strong> are examples of MIME types.
            </p>
            <p>Below is an example request for a resource with id <i>5</i> in a <i>cars</i> resource on a server:</p>
            <pre><code class="language-http">GET /cars/5
Accept: text/json text/html</code></pre>
            <h4>Paths</h4>
            <p>Paths are required in a request, and they indicate where to find the requested resource. In the example
                request above, the path is <strong>/cars/5</strong></p>
            <h3>Sending Responses</h3>
            <p>When sending a response back to the client, the server must include a <strong>content-type</strong> in
                the <strong>header</strong> of the response. These content-types are also MIME Types, and they tell the
                client what type of content to expect. The server must also include a response code to let the user know
                of the outcome.</p>
            <pre><code class="language-http">Status Code: 200 (OK)
Content-type: application/json</code></pre>
