        <h2>What is HTTP?</h2>
        <p><strong>HTTP</strong> stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is used to structure requests and responses
            over the internet. <strong>HTTP</strong> requires that data is transferred from one point to another over
            the network.</p>
        <h2>What is TCP?</h2>
        <p><strong>TCP</strong> (Transmission Control Protocol) is what actually handles the transfer of data. TCP is
            used to manage many types of internet connections in which one computer wants to send data to another.</p>
        <h2>How it all works together</h2>
        <p>When you type an address into the browser to load a webpage, you command <strong>TCP</strong> to open a
            connection between your
            browser (the client) and the server to which the url relates to. Once the TCP connection is established, the
            client sends a <strong>HTTP <i>GET</i></strong> request to
            request the webpage. With HTTP/1.0 (the first version of HTTP), once the browser sends back a response,
            the <strong>TCP</strong> connection is closed.</p>
